  <h2>Research Activity</h2>

  <h3 class="research_accent">Signal Processing and Machine learning</h3>
    <p>In this work, we worked on classification of Media Files based on their location of recording, using Supervised Machine Learning algorithm (support vector machine). We employed a signal extraction algorithm, Fourier Analysis, feature extraction and SVM to classify the origin of recording of audio files, exploiting power signatures embedded in them from the location of recording. Moreover, we managed to introduce a novel feature that increased the classification accuracy by a significant margin. </p>
    <p>Designed a designated device for capturing sample audio data file for ENF at our locality.</p>
    <p>We ranked 11th among 52 teams from 23 countries. The details of the competition are delineated in the <a href="">IEEE SP Cup 2016</a>section of this website.</p>

    <h4>"CoNTe: A Core Network Temporal Blockchain for 5G"</h4>
        <p><i>S Platt, L Sanabria-Russo, M Oliver. Sensors 2020, 20, 5281.</i></p>
        <p>Virtual Network Functions allow the effective separation between hardware and network functionality, a strong paradigm shift from previously tightly integrated monolithic, vendor, and technology dependent deployments. 
            In this virtualized paradigm, all aspects of network operations can be made to deploy on demand, dynamically scale, as well as be shared and interworked in ways that mirror behaviors of general cloud computing. 
            To date, although seeing rising demand, distributed ledger technology remains largely incompatible in such elastic deployments, by its nature as functioning as an immutable record store. 
            This work focuses on the structural incompatibility of current blockchain designs and proposes a novel, temporal blockchain design built atop federated byzantine agreement, which has the ability to dynamically scale and be packaged as a Virtual Network Function (VNF) for the 5G Core.</p>
